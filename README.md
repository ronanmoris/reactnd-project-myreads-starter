# MyReads App

This is an assignment from Udacity's React Fundamentals course.

The app helps you systematically organise your books in three different shelves:

- Currently Reading
- Want to Read
- Read

It also allows you to add more books to the shelves.

## To Quickstart

- clone the repository
- cd into the root of the project and run `npm install` to install all project dependencies.
- start the development server with `npm start`

## Important

The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.

## Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). You can find more information on how to perform common tasks [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).

## Contributing

This repository is the starter code for _all_ Udacity students. Therefore, we most likely will not accept pull requests.
